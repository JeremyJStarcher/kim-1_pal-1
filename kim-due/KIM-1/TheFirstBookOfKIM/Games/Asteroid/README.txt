ASTEROID
BY STAN OCKERS

YOU ARE PILOTING YOUR SPACECRAFT BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER WHEN
YOU ENCOUNTER A DENSE PORTION OF THE ASTEROID BELT. PRESS KEY
ZERO TO MOVE LEFT, THREE TO MOVE RIGHT. WHEN YOUR CRAFT IS HIT
THE DISPLAY WILL GIVE A NUMBER TO INDICATE HOW SUCESSFUL YOU
WERE. THE PROGRAM STARTS AT 0200.

CHANGES -
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN ASTEROID FIELD STARTING AT 02D5. THE
GROUP COUNT,(C02B6), WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED IF THE FIELD SIZE
DIFFERS. THE SPEED OF THE CRAFT MOVING THROUGH THE FIELD IS
CONTROLLED BY 027E. WHAT ABOUT A VARYING SPEED, SLOW AT FIRST
AND SPEEDING UP AS YOU GET INTO THE FIELD? WHAT ABOUT A FINAL
"DESTINATION COUNT" AND A SIGNAL TO INDICATE YOU HAVE REACHED
YOUR DESTINATION? HOW ABOUT ALLOWING A HIT OR TWO BEFORE YOU
ARE FINALLY DISABLED?
