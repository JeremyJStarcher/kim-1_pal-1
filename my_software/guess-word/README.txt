GUESSWORD (unsensored)

There are two versions of the game for a 5K KIM-1 (or PAL-1) or another version
for the KIM-1 with a 32K memory expansion at $2000.

GUESS WORD will choose a random word from its built in dictionary and display
it on the built-in LED screen one letter at a time as players sit around the
KIM-1 trying to guess the word.

Score as appropriate. 

WARNING:  The wordlist was randomly chosen from my Linux distro's spelling
dictionary and may contain words that will be offensive to someone.

REQUIREMENTS:
    For the PAL-1, the second RIOT card is NOT needed.  GuessWord was designed
    to use the system timer.

TO LOAD (32K version)

Load the wordlist.  You may either load the paper tape version or you may
copy the .HEX file to a tape emulator device.

Then load the executable code.  This will load in the KIM's base memory.

The run address is $0200.
